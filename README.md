# Smart-Bike-Seat

People value safety that is non-intrusive and reliable. As bikers, we wanted to create a device that caters to the user’s safety, especially in potentially dangerous situations. The Smart Bike Seat provides statistics based on a user’s biking time, adds functional brake lights minimizing biking danger in the dark, and can send an immediate distress signal should the user crash and is knocked out. 

Our device reads Gyroscope and Accelerometer data from the LSMD6S3 in conjunction to using the Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing Dev to send data and alerts to a cloud server interfaced with Microsoft Azure. Users of the Azure Web App will be notified when a biker with our device is in danger.
